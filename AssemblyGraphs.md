# Exploring assembly graphs

## Install bandage onto your VM

We are going to use Ryan Wick's excellent [Bandage](https://github.com/rrwick/Bandage) program to explore 
some assembly graphs from the infant gut data set. First install Bandage:

```
cd ~/repos
mkdir Bandage 
cd Bandage 
wget https://github.com/rrwick/Bandage/releases/download/v0.8.1/Bandage_Ubuntu_dynamic_v0_8_1.zip
unzip Bandage_Ubuntu_dynamic_v0_8_1.zip
cp Bandage ~/bin
```

## Now get two example example assembly graphs

We constructed two coassembly graphs from the first seven 1M subsampled infant gut samples.

```
cd Projects/InfantGut

mkdir AssemblyGraphs

cd AssemblyGraphs 

wget https://desmantutorial.s3.climb.ac.uk/contigs_colorM.gfa
wget https://desmantutorial.s3.climb.ac.uk/high_res_colorM.gfa
```

Start up Bandage:
```
Bandage
```

Open up the first of these files contigs_colorM.gfa in Bandage. You should see something like this:

![Bandage contigs](./Figures/contigs_bandage.png)

The colors correspond to four MAGs we obtained from clustering the Spades contigs: 
* Bin3 magenta, E. faecalis
* Bin7 blue 
* Bin12 red
* Bin19 green, Staph. epidermidis

Why are some of the bins fragmented?

Can you find any contigs that are misassigned

Locate these two contigs with the search feature:

*NODE_55_length_32977_cov_19.323249
*NODE_327_length_8496_cov_5.646014

These correspond to contigs annotated to the single-copy core gene COG0060 in Bin19. Why are there two of them? 
Try blasting the sequences against the NCBI.

Now open up the file high_res_colorM.gfa

And find these nodes. Corresponding to COG0016 in Bin19:
* start 2524601
* end 2816027
